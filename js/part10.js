// Nested if

// in the previous video we have discussed about If  
// Definition of Nested IF else

/* Its just a rabbit Hole of If Else What I am trying to say. you have 
countless excuses to ask a girl on a date!

for example a guy want to ask her out for date 
 IF she say no, or Else If she slap, or else if she kick me on my nuts!! 
 Forget it. out of the loop end the program class end buy!!
*/

/* 
    well this is a real example of if else but computer doesn't speak our 
    language thats why we call it a Computer language not a human language
     or english Language
*/

/* 
    so how we write nested if else condition
    so far we see there are endless if before saying yes or no refiring to 
    the poor boy
